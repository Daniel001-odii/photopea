			<h1>Creating Photopea</h1>
			<div class="entry">

				<p>Photopea is an advanced image editor, which evolved for more than four years. In terms of complexity, it can be placed next to Adobe Photoshop or GNU GIMP.</p>
				
				<span id="more-660"></span>
				
				<p>It was built around three ideas: <b>make advanced editing accessible</b> to everyone (in terms of cost and device requirements), <b>remove borders</b> between programs (support all existing file formats instead of inventing a new format) and make designers <b>less dependent</b> on their software (if it suddenly stops working, you should still have a chance to use your files somehow).</p>

				<p>Now, an the end of 2017, there is a <a href="//www.Photopea.com">web-based editor Photopea</a>, that runs on every device. It has an excellent support for PSD and Sketch files. It can be used by anybody for free and has been visited by more than <b>2.5 millions of people</b>, who spent <b>120 000 hours</b> using it.</p>
				
				
				<h2>The Development</h2>
				
				<p>My name is Ivan Kutskir <!--(Kuckir, Куцкір)--> and I am the only developer of Photopea. I am 27 years old graduate of the <a href="//www.mff.cuni.cz/to.en/">Charles University in Prague</a>. I live in Prague, Czech Republic, but I was born in Ukraine.</p>
				
				<a target="_blank" href="//blog.photopea.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/picture_narrow.jpg"><img src="//blog.photopea.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/picture_narrow.jpg" style="width:300px" /></a>
				
				<p>I did things such as programming, creating icons for tools, or writing all posts on this blog. I even <a href="//www.facebook.com/photopea/photos/a.1703140446613703.1073741829.1408717406056010/1856597134601366/?type=3&theater">designed the logo</a>. Working on PP was my hobby and I truly enjoyed it (most of the time).</p>
				
				<p>At the beginning, I had no hopes of making anything useful, I was just playing around. The idea of creating an advanced image editor on my own seemed stupid, and making it a webapp seemed like a complete joke.</p>
				
				<p>After some time, my toy editor started to become more and more powerful. The response from users was very positive, so I decided to keep working on it as long as I can. I have solved <a href="//github.com/photopea/photopea/issues">400 bugs and feature requests from users</a>. I also produced <a href="//github.com/photopea">several libraries</a>, that are free to use for everybody (open-source under the MIT licence).</p>
				
				<h2>The Future</h2>
				
				<p>Photopea already offers advanced image editing tools and can even replace commercial editors to a large extent.
				It is also <b>a platform</b>, which allows adding new state-of-the-art features much faster than the competition. When somebody suggests a new kick-ass feature, it can appear in Photopea the next day. All users always use the latest version of the software.</p>
				
				<p>I don't plan to keep doing everything myself. I want to create a team of developers as soon as it is possible. I believe we can fully catch up with our competitors and even get beyond. We will keep moving towards the most advanced and the most accessible image editor in the world.</p>
				
				<p>You can hep me achieve it by using Photopea, recommending it to your friends, making tutorials, or just sharing the info on social networks (many of you already do).
